Last updated: 08.28.2020

## Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to show how to work with variables and data types.

## Prerequisites

You have finished the [t1-getting-started-tutorial](../t1-getting-started/readme.md).  This tutorial sets up
Python and IntelliJ for future tutorials.

## Procedures

1. Open up your IntelliJ application. 

    ![t2-open-intellij](../images/t2-opening_up_intellij.png)

    On the left part of the screen, you should see the **Project** window and the **first_application**
    folder should be visible. If the **first_application** folder is not open, go to the **File** menu,
    click on the **Open..** menu item, and navigate to the **first_application** folder.

1. Highlight the folder **first_application** in the **Project** window.
1. Right click on **first_application**, select the menu item **New** and the sub menu **Python File** to
create a new Python file as is shown below.

1. Name the new file **variables_and_data_types.py**.  Your screen should appear like the screenshot below.
   On the left **Project** window, your python file is highlighted.  On the right window, your Python file
   appears.  This is where we will enter our code.
