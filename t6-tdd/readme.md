Last updated: 09.10.2020

## Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce Test Driven Development (TDD).  You will
be shown how to create an example application using TDD.

## Prerequisites

You have finished the [t5-oop-part2](../t5-oop-part2/readme.md).  This tutorial provides the necessary foundation you 
need to perform this tutorial.  If you already have a foundation in using **OOP**, you may skip this prerequisite.

## Procedures

1. Open up your IntelliJ application.

    folder should be visible. If the **first_application** folder is not open, go to the **File** menu,
    click on the **Open..** menu item, and navigate to the **first_application** folder.
