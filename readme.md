# Working with Python

Last updated: 08.27.2020

## Purpose

The purpose of the repo is to provide simple tutorials 
for programming with **python**.

Python has been around since 1989. The language has evolved into one of the 
most powerful and feature rich languages.  The language is simple to pick up 
and allows people to automate tasks efficiently, eloquently, 
and in little time.

One example of a need for Python is while programming in Ansible.
Ansible is a great language that uses Python under the hoods.  While most tasks 
can be done in Ansible, Ansible sometimes needs new modules or filters for users
to complete their tasks and have maintainable Ansible.

One caveat to using Python is every programming language has
their pluses and minuses.  Python is no exception.  What can be done in Python, 
other languages might have better support, documentation, and other benefits 
that point to using the other languages.  Always evaluate what you need to do, 
create a matrix of plus and minuses of using the languages, and then make a 
well informed decision.  This comes from a developer that uses different languages 
based on evaluation.  No language is the best for everything.

## Prerequisites

Windows, Fedora, or Centos operating systems.
